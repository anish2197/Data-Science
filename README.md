## Mini Projects

This is a list of projects that I worked on to learn how to solve real world industry problems.

| Problem | Description | Algorithm | Accuracy | Implementation | Dataset | Creation Date |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Fintech Case Study | Directing customers to subscription through App Behaviour Analysis | Logistic Regression | 76% | [Python (sklearn,numpy)](https://github.com/anish2197/Data-Science/tree/master/Mini%20Projects/Fintech%20Case%20Study) | [App Behaviour Dataset](http://www.superdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/CS3_Data.zip) | 22/12/2018
| Breast Cancer Classification | Classified cancer type into Benign or Malignant | Support Vector Machine | 96% | [Python (sklearn,numpy)](https://github.com/anish2197/Data-Science/tree/master/Mini%20Projects/Breast%20Cancer%20Classification) | [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) | 20/11/2018


## Programming Showcase

In this section I want to show off my knowledge about using various ML and AI related algorithms, frameworks, programming languages, packages, libraries etc. This includes the assignments I performed to learn how an algorithm works.
